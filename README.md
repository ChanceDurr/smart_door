# Smart Door Project

## Planning

### Ideas

- Lock door with phone, also have unlock with hand rfid.
- Camera on outside facing with facial recognition
- LCD Panel on inside of door with basic information and option to show what camera sees
- Maybe some sort of voice activation for unlocking as well
- Speaker for talking back.
- Maybe a keypad for the unlocking door as well
- website for storing and checking who was near the door.
